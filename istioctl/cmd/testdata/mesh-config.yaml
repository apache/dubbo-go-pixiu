  # Where should envoy's configuration be stored in the istio-proxy container
  configPath: "/etc/istio/proxy"
  binaryPath: "/usr/local/bin/envoy"
  # The pseudo service name used for Envoy.

  # These settings that determine how long an old Envoy
  # process should be kept alive after an occasional reload.

  #
  # The mode used to redirect inbound connections to Envoy. This setting
  # has no effect on outbound traffic: iptables REDIRECT is always used for
  # outbound connections.
  # If "REDIRECT", use iptables REDIRECT to NAT and redirect to Envoy.
  # The "REDIRECT" mode loses source addresses during redirection.
  # If "TPROXY", use iptables TPROXY to redirect to Envoy.
  # The "TPROXY" mode preserves both the source and destination IP
  # addresses and ports, so that they can be used for advanced filtering
  # and manipulation.
  # The "TPROXY" mode also configures the sidecar to run with the
  # CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which is required to use TPROXY.
  #interceptionMode: REDIRECT
  #
  # Port where Envoy listens (on local host) for admin commands
  # You can exec into the istio-proxy container in a pod and
  # curl the admin port (curl http://localhost:15000/) to obtain
  # diagnostic information from Envoy. See
  # https://lyft.github.io/envoy/docs/operations/admin.html
