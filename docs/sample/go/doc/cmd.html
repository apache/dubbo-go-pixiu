<p>
There is a suite of programs to build and process Go source code.
Instead of being run directly, programs in the suite are usually invoked
by the <a href="/cmd/go/">go</a> program.
</p>

<p>
The most common way to run these programs is as a subcommand of the go program,
for instance as <code>go fmt</code>. Run like this, the command operates on
complete packages of Go source code, with the go program invoking the
underlying binary with arguments appropriate to package-level processing.
</p>

<p>
The programs can also be run as stand-alone binaries, with unmodified arguments,
using the go <code>tool</code> subcommand, such as <code>go tool cgo</code>.
For most commands this is mainly useful for debugging.
Some of the commands, such as <code>pprof</code>, are accessible only through
the go <code>tool</code> subcommand.
</p>

<p>
Finally the <code>fmt</code> and <code>godoc</code> commands are installed
as regular binaries called <code>gofmt</code> and <code>godoc</code> because
they are so often referenced.
