# This script runs can be used to emit (readable) compile tracing info when building go packages

# Before and after usage, `go clean -cache` is suggested since go seems to cache the toolexec output
# Usage: `go build -toolexec=$PWD/tools/go-compile-verbose ./... |& grep -v '^#'`
# Usage (compile all tests only): `go test -exec=true -toolexec=$PWD/tools/go-compile-verbose ./... |& grep -v '^#'`
